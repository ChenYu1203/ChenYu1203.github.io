				Visuals catch attention, and are easily remembered by people. More often, they are the first chance at impressing a potential customer and holding their interest for as long as possible.<br/>
				視覺效果總是吸引著人們的注意，並且不容易忘記，因此，視覺設計經常是打動潛在客戶並保持其興趣的唯一機會。<br/>
				That’s why so much attention is paid to the work of graphic designers these days. The industry is growing with its demand, and with such demand, the number of graphic designers popping up is rapidly rising, too. Graphic designers take the vision of their clients and bring it to life by visual communication.<br/>
				這就是為什麼人們如此關注平面設計師的發展，這個行業隨著需求的增長而急速成長，並且隨著不同種類的需求，圖形設計師的多樣化，也在以驚人的速度變化中，他們需要採用客戶需要的效果，通過視覺設計，與觀眾交流，並傳達其意義。<br/>

				<h2 id="favorites">- Cipe Pineles -</h2>
				<img id="f2" src="img/1*b3HSZRajSJyYSL7ALk_Z5A.jpeg"><br/>
				<b>"We tried to make the prosaic attractive without using the tired clichés of false glamour. You might say we tried to convey the attractiveness of reality, as opposed to the glitter of a never-never land."</b><br/>
				Cipe Pineles was one of the most prominent designers of the twentieth century and one of the first female art directors to work at a major magazine. She served in that capacity at Glamour, Seventeen, and Charm. Her career was also full of a lot of firsts; She was the first female designer to become a member of the Art Directors Club in New York, the first autonomous female art director for a magazine. She was also the first designer to hire fine artists to illustrate mass market publications which began a long standing trend within magazine design that would go on to shape the magazine design industry.<br/>
				<br/>
				Cipe Pineles是20世紀最傑出的設計師之一，也是最早在大型雜誌社工作的女性藝術總監之一。 她曾在Glamour, Seventeen, and Charm雜誌社中任職。 她的職業生涯也為視覺設計開創了許多第一次。 她是第一位成為紐約藝術總監俱樂部成員的女性設計師，也是第一位雜誌的獨立女性藝術總監。同時也是第一位聘請優秀藝術家來說明大眾出版物的設計師，這促使了雜誌設計領域的長期發展，並最終影響了整個雜誌設計行業。

				<h2 id="favorites">- Alexey Brodovitch -</h2>
				<img id="f1" src="img/spread7.jpg"><br/>
				<b>"If you know yourself, you are doomed."</b><br/>
				Alexey Brodovitch is known foremost for his work on the american fashion-magazine Harper's bazaar. He was the first art director to integrate image and text. Most american magazines at that time used text and illustration seperately, dividing them by wide white margins. The typeface he preferred was Bodoni, but when needed he switched to Stencil, Typewriter or a script. He matched the typeface with the feeling or with the need for an appropiate effect. Legibility was not his primary concern. His layouts are easily recognized by his generous use of white space. Colleagues at other magazines saw his sparse designs as truly elegant, but a waste of valuable space.<br/>
				<br/>
				Alexey Brodovitch以其在美國時尚雜誌Harper義賣市場上的作品而聞名。 他是第一位完美地整合圖像和文字的藝術總監。 當時，大多數美國雜誌都單獨使用文字和插圖，並用寬闊的空白將它們分開。 他偏愛的字體是襯線字體，但必要時也會改用了其他字體，他的專長就是使字體符合整體感覺或適合的效果，易讀性不是他的主要目的。 對空白的大膽使用，是他的特色，因為人們常將他那看似浪費空間的設計，視為真正的優雅。

				<b>“Design that needed guts from the creator and still carries the ghost of these guts in the final execution.”</b><br/>
				Stefan Sagmeister is an accomplished contemporary designer with an impressive client list, ranging from The Rolling Stones and HBO to the Guggenheim. He began his design career at the age of 15 at "Alphorn", an Austrian Youth magazine, which is named after the traditional Alpine musical instrument.

He has long stated that he wants to create work that ‘touches the heart’ of the viewer.<br/>
				<br/>
