			<h1>The topic for my thematic website.</h1>
			<section>
				The topic for my thematic website will be to show some beginner's guide to Graphic Design, and also to share some of my design works and the background ideas about them. To better understand the meaning of graphic design, it is important to be aware of the elements and principles that make up design. Thus, in my website, the content will be categorized into different genres on the left side, including graphic design tools, design jobs, types of graphic designs, and also lots of collections by popular graphic designers.
