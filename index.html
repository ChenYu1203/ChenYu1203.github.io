    		<h2>I’m Wong, Chen-Yu.</h2>

    			I like making things and meeting new people.

    		<p>
    			I’m an undergraduate student of National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan currently studying Foreign Language and Literature (FLL) and also Economics. I give my first try setting up a personal website for a project in my bilingual web design course. Having my own website has always been my dream because managing a website, especially bilingual one, is like connecting to lots of different people around the world. Although I haven’t fully decided the contents and appearance of my web, I hope this web will not only be a free place for me to share some “crazy” imagination about what I feel about the world, but also be a way for me to help the people in need which is one of my lifetime goals. 

    		</p>
    		<p>
    			I’ve always been intrigued by design, art, traveling, photography, country music, classic movies, detective novels, fabulous food, and even interesting conversations.
    		</p>
    		<p>
    			In the meantime, I’m still seeking to imagine the incredible, to achieve the extraordinary, to work hard for things that set my soul on fire, and to be surrounded by those who bring out the best of me.

    			<h2>A bit More about me</h2>
    			I was born in Taiwan, and both of my parents are Taiwanese, but due to my father’s occupation as international businessman, I had the opportunity to travel around the world and experience distinctive culture, people, and languages as a child. These experiences taught me to build up my ability to adapt different culture and perspectives, and also inspired my passion for languages which is the foundation of civilization holding everyone together. So who am I? I am a multicultural, international, open-minded Taiwanese that has a passion in learning new things and meeting new people.
