    			I’m an undergraduate student of National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan currently studying Foreign Languages and Literature (FLL) and also Economics. I’ve always been intrigued by design, art, traveling, photography, country music, classic movies, detective novels, fabulous food, and even interesting conversations. In the Meantime, I’m still seeking to imagine the incredible, to achieve the extraordinary, to work hard for things that set my soul on fire, and to be surrounded by those who bring out the best of me.

                I give my first try setting up a personal website for a project in my bilingual web design course. Having my own website has always been my dream because managing a website, especially bilingual one, is like connecting to lots of different people around the world. When it comes to the thematic of my website, I will focus on the graphic design field that I’ve been interested for a long time. I love to design experiences, big to small, digital to analogue, with moments of delight. Music also inspires a lot to my works, and I believe that simply enjoying life and the pleasure that come with it help in the design process. Function is beauty just as much as form, but combining the two is an ART.  Yes, an art. I’m super excited to see how far I go in the design field, and this website is just the beginning.
